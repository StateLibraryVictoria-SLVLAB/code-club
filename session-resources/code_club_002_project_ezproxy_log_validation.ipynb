    "## Pseudocode\n",
    "\n",
    "\"*pseudocode*\", fun to say isn't it? When tackling most projects that involve a technical element it's really useful to plan it out, and pseudocode is an effective way to do so. \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, a computer program does three things:\n",
    "    1. takes something as an input\n",
    "    2. performs a series of actions based on the input\n",
    "    3. outputs something as a result\n",
    "\n",
    "Huge generalisation, but often inputs and outputs are somewhat stardardised. However, the bit that happens in the middle usually has the most scope for variation, and therefore pseudocode is particularly useful. But what is pseudocode? Pseudocode is a skeleton outline of the logic that your code will follow. It's generally written in non-technical (or at least non-coding-language-specific) language. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the reasons it's so useful are:\n",
    "- it forces you to think through the logic of getting from your inputs to your desired outputs. \n",
    "- it also helps you consider choices like what data structures to use (e.g. a dictionary versus a list) and what packages make use of\n",
    "- it gives a set of checkpoints for you to tick-off: it can be very easy when trying to solve a specific problem to get too into the weeds and come up with a solution that solves something that you don't need.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a good intro to writing pseudocode [https://www.wikihow.com/Write-Pseudocode](https://www.wikihow.com/Write-Pseudocode)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pseudocode exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "- pick a coding project (usefully there's one below)\n",
    "- in groups of more than one person (where possible) spend 10-15 mins writing some pseudocode.\n",
    "    - things to consider:\n",
    "        - what is your input? And what is the best way to structure the data, e.g. as a list, dictionary, dataframe etc.?\n",
    "        - what is the expected output? How do you need to shape your data to meet that?\n",
    "        - breaking down the actions into logical chunks\n",
    "        - handling errors - should the programme stop? Should it skip over lines?\n",
    "        - what existing packages might be helpful? \n",
