These are all huge topics, but this notebook takes inspiration from Fastai's [Jeremy Howard](https://jeremy.fast.ai/) and takes a top-down approach. A simple analogy to explain this approach is to imagine learning to play a sport or game as a child: the first step isn't to learn all of the rules and their intricacies, it's to play! And through doing so, the game and it's rules begins to make more sense. In that spirit, read through the Notebook and if things don't immediately make sense, make a note and come back to it. For each section I've linked to other tutorials which go into more depth."
