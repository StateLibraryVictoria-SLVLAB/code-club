# Code Club

This repository contains materials related to State Library Victoria's Code Club, an initiative intended to help improve digital literacy across the organisation's staff. It is also intended to make coding less daunting, encourage experimentation and maybe also be fun.

Read about Code Club's inception on the SLV LAB site - [https://lab.slv.vic.gov.au/experiments/code-club](https://lab.slv.vic.gov.au/experiments/code-club)

## [Session resources](./session-resources/)

### Python study club

A series of Jupyter notebooks written to introduce non-coders to Python.

### Storiiies

An introduction to IIIF via Storiiies. Storiiies is an open-source tool created by [Cogapp](https://www.cogapp.com/) that allows users to create visual, interactive stories from any image. Here is a link to the R+D page for Storiiies [https://www.cogapp.com/r-d/storiiies](https://www.cogapp.com/r-d/storiiies).

The Storiiies editor makes use of the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) to create a _manifest_ that records the image regions and any accompanying descriptions generated when creating a story.

### Computer Vision (FastAI): Is it a bird?

[Nick Paustian](https://github.com/nickpaustian-slv) lead an introduction to machine learning that aimed to demonstrate the concepts underpinning modern "AI" technologies. Nick used an adapted version of a tutorial from FastAI, see the notebook here - [https://www.kaggle.com/code/nickpaustianslv/codeclub-computer-vision-fastai](https://www.kaggle.com/code/nickpaustianslv/codeclub-computer-vision-fastai)

### Get started with Trove API

[Susannah Bourke](https://github.com/susannah-slv) lead a workshop demonstrating how to use the Trove API to access the rich collections of data it contains. View the notebook deployed on Kaggle here - [https://www.kaggle.com/code/susannahbourke/codeclub-get-started-with-trove-api](https://www.kaggle.com/code/susannahbourke/codeclub-get-started-with-trove-api)

### SQL Carmen San Diego + SQL Murder Mystery

[Mark Romeo](https://github.com/mromeo-slv) shared his experiences using GenAI tools like ChatGPT to tackle some of his day-to-day code problems. Mark also put together a couple of fun SQL exercises for the group to attempt using GenAI. As with previous workshops, we hope these activities will lead to an interesting and thoughtful discussion about the technologies being showcased.

### Mapping Melbourne

The Mapping Melbourne workshop demosntrates how to create an interactive map of Melbourne Landmarks using the open-source mapping library Leaflet and a dataset published by the Library to the data.vic platform.
